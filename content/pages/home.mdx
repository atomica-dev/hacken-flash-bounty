      The LandX Safety Module introduces a staking pool to the LandX community,
      allowing stakers the opportunity to earn rewards from insurance premiums
      and LandX incentives. Stakers can earn  rewards from the paid insurance
      premiums and LandX incentives. Staking on the module carries a small risk
      of stake slashing in the case of a LandX shortfall event.\
