      ### **Why stake?**


      As a HAI staker, you receive **high rewards** in exchange for the risk of
      finding a critical vulnerability in the Bug Bounty.


      ### **The Bug bounty pool will be slashed if:**


      1. Whitehats will find the **critical vulnerability** in the Flash Bug
      Bounty Scope.

      2. and the HackenProof triage team decides to pay the whitehat and creates
      the Payout Request.

      3. and Payout Approver reviews the payout request and approves the
      request.
