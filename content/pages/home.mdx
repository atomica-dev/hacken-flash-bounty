      **Why stake?**


      If you are a **Whitehat**, you can now **switch** **from** a
      "**Proof-of-Work**" to a "**Proof-of-Stake**" model and **earn rewards**
      for the **time you spend** reviewing code.


      **How it works?**


      1. Review code included in the Hacken Flash Bug Bounty scope.

      2. Feeling confident about the code quality and security?

      3. Stake in the "Proof-of-Safety" pool and earn yield from:


      * \- Insurance premium share from the sold insurance

      * \- Incentive rewards from the DAOs

      * \- Incentive rewards from Hacken.


      **The "Proof-of-Safety pool" will be slashed if:**


      1. Whitehats will find the Bug Bounty's Critical Severity in the [LandX
      protocol](https://www.landx.fi/)

      2. or/and [LandX protocol](https://www.landx.fi/) will be hacked.
