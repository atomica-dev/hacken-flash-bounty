    content: >
      If you are a Whitehat, you can now switch from a "Proof-of-Work" to a
      "Proof-of-Stake" model and earn rewards for the time you spend reviewing
      code.


      How it works?


      * Review the code included in the HackenProof Benqi Flash Bug Bonty scope.

      * If you are sure of the code's security, you can stake the HAI tokens
      into the HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty "Proof-of-Safety pool" and receive
      the rewards.

    content: "Financial incentives for high quality code security reviews\n\nOnly [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") whitehats can dive deep into code and spend more time on code review. Why would they do that? Because they earn rewards not only when they find vulnerabilities, but even when the code is good - as long as they are willing to stake their own money into a high-yield Insurance/Bounty Capital Pool. Never before have whitehats been able to earn rewards for reviewing the code base regardless of whether they find vulnerabilities. Only the [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") Flash Bug Bounty gives your code this level of attention. \n\n\\\n**HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty is MORE VISIBLE to whitehats**\n\nIt is insanely hard to attract top whitehats through standard bug bounties.\LWith the [HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\"), the project would leapfrog the competition\Lfor whitehats and community attention.\n\nThe protocol can icentivize the [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") whitehats by the reward program. It means that the whitehats reward program can be launched after code updates, fixes.\n\n**Ongoing Security Maintenance**\\\nUnlike standard bug bounty or audit options, [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") or/and Protocol DAO can incentivize whitehats to continuously monitor and maintain the security of your codebase. With their bounty at stake, whitehats have a vested interest in promptly addressing new vulnerabilities and contributing to ongoing security improvements, rather than fixing it once and forgetting about the security of your DAO/dApp/Protocol.\n"

      The "Proof-of-Safety pool" will be slashed if:


      * Whitehats will find the Bug Bounty's Critical Severity in the [LandX
      protocol](https://www.landx.fi/)

      * or/and [LandX protocol](https://www.landx.fi/) will be hacked.
  - header: What is Atomica?
    content: >
      [Atomica.org](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") is a Web3 protocol to deploy
      two-sided insurance markets.


      Using [Atomica.org](Atomica.org "Atomica.org"), DeFi protocols can deploy,
      bootstrap and manage their own Safety Module. For example, protocols like
      [LandX](Landx.fi "LandX") can deploy and embed protection and insurance of
      any kind, including smart contract hacks/bugs, stablecoins and LSDs
      de-pegging, economic attacks, oracle failure, etc., and even boost the
      amount of Bug Bounties they offer using 3rd party capital from depositors
      in their Safety Module.


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") mission is to reduce risk for DeFi
      users by offering a range of protection options and to provide capital
      efficiency for liquidity providers (stakers).


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") research and development has been
      funded by grants from [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/ "Maker DAO"),
      [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/ "Balancer"),
      [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io "Filecoin"), [The
      Graph](https://thegraph.com/ "The Graph") and
      [Protofire](https://protofire.io/ "Protofire.io").
