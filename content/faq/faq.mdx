  - header: How can Whitehats participate in the Hacken Flash Bounty Program?
    content: >
      If you are a Whitehat, you can now switch from a "Proof-of-Work" to a
      "Proof-of-Stake" model and earn rewards for the time you spend reviewing
      code.


      How it works?


      * Review the code included in the HackenProof Benqi Flash Bug Bonty scope.

      * If you are sure of the code's security, you can stake the HAI tokens
      into the HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty "Proof-of-Safety pool" and receive
      the rewards.
  - header: 'As a Web3 project, what do I get out of the hacking bug bounty program?'
    content: >
      **Financial Incentives for Code Quality Review:**\

      Only Hacken Audit Pro whitehats will also review code audited by Hacken
      Whitehats. Why would they do so? Because they earn rewards not only when
      they find vulnerabilities, but also even if the code is good - as long as
      they are willing to stake their own funds in high-yield Insurance/Bounty
      Capital Pool. Never before could Whitehats earn rewards for reviewing your
      code base regardless whether they find vulnerabilities. Only Hacken Flash
      Bug Bounty gives your code this amount of attention. \

      \

      **Continuous Security Maintenance:**\

      Unlike alternative bug bounty or audit options, Hacken incentivizes
      whitehats to continuously monitor and maintain the security of your
      codebase. With their deposit at stake, they have a vested interest in
      promptly addressing any new vulnerabilities, thereby contributing to
      ongoing security improvements rather than just fixing once and forgetting
      about safety of your DAO/dApp/Protocol.

  - header: Who decides on bug bounty payouts?
    content: >
      The Pool Cap is a limit on the maximum amount of tokens that can be
      deposited into a pool. If the Pool Cap is reached, it means that the pool
      is "Sold Out" and is no longer accepting liquidity.
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect LNDX token holders?
    content: >
      LNDX token holders are protected because the market the price of the LNDX
      token depends on current and future [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX
      Protocol") fees. These fees are organically generated when users mint and
      hold xTokens. With the increased protection enjoyed by xToken holders,
      LandX is no longer at risk of losing revenue due to natural weather risks
      and climate change. Because [LandX
      Protocol](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) Revenue is now
      protected, $LNDX has become much safer to hold and stake for anyone who
      wants to participate in an infrastructure layer that powers the next
      generation of Real World Asset (RWA) assets and the financing of the
      global food supply chain.
  - header: What's the risk? Could I lose money?
    content: >
      The "Proof-of-Safety pool" will be slashed if:


      * Whitehats will find the Bug Bounty's Critical Severity in the [LandX
      protocol](https://www.landx.fi/)

      * or/and [LandX protocol](https://www.landx.fi/) will be hacked.
  - header: What is Atomica?
    content: >
      [Atomica.org](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") is a Web3 protocol to deploy
      two-sided insurance markets.


      Using [Atomica.org](Atomica.org "Atomica.org"), DeFi protocols can deploy,
      bootstrap and manage their own Safety Module. For example, protocols like
      [LandX](Landx.fi "LandX") can deploy and embed protection and insurance of
      any kind, including smart contract hacks/bugs, stablecoins and LSDs
      de-pegging, economic attacks, oracle failure, etc., and even boost the
      amount of Bug Bounties they offer using 3rd party capital from depositors
      in their Safety Module.


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") mission is to reduce risk for DeFi
      users by offering a range of protection options and to provide capital
      efficiency for liquidity providers (stakers).


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") research and development has been
      funded by grants from [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/ "Maker DAO"),
      [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/ "Balancer"),
      [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io "Filecoin"), [The
      Graph](https://thegraph.com/ "The Graph") and
      [Protofire](https://protofire.io/ "Protofire.io").
