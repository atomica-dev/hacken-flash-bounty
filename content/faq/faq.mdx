  - header: What is Hacken Flash Bug Bounty?
    content: >
      Unlike traditional bug bounties where whitehats only get paid for the
      vulnerabilities they find, the [Hackenproof](https://hackenproof.com/
      "hackenproof.com") Flash Bug Bounty allows whitehats to earn money for
      secure code reviews as well. Whitehats can put their money into a pool and
      be rewarded based on the overall security of the codebase.


      * \- The more code you review and contribute to the proof-of-security
      pool, the more you earn.

      * \- The longer you stake in to the proof-of-security pool, the the more
      you earn.

  - header: How can Whitehats participate in the Hacken Flash Bounty Program?
    content: >
      If you are a Whitehat, you can now switch from a "Proof-of-Work" to a
      "Proof-of-Stake" model and earn rewards for the time you spend reviewing
      code.


      **How it works?**


      * \- Review the code included in the
      [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ "hackenproof.com") Benqi Flash Bug
      Bonty scope.

      * \- If you are sure of the code's security, you can stake the HAI tokens
      into the [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ "hackenproof.com") Flash
      Bug Bounty "Proof-of-Safety pool" and receive the rewards.
  - header: 'As a Web3 project, what do I get out of the hacking bug bounty program?'
    content: "**Financial incentives for high quality code security reviews**\n\nOnly [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") whitehats can dive deep into code and spend more time on code review. Why would they do that? Because they earn rewards not only when they find vulnerabilities, but even when the code is good - as long as they are willing to stake their own money into a high-yield Insurance/Bounty Capital Pool. Never before have whitehats been able to earn rewards for reviewing the code base regardless of whether they find vulnerabilities. Only the [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") Flash Bug Bounty gives your code this level of attention.\n\n\\\n**HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty is MORE VISIBLE to whitehats**\n\nIt is insanely hard to attract top whitehats through standard bug bounties.\LWith the [HackenProof Flash Bug Bounty](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\"), the project would leapfrog the competition\Lfor whitehats and community attention.\n\nThe protocol can icentivize the [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") whitehats by the reward program. It means that the whitehats reward program can be launched after code updates, fixes.\n\n**Ongoing Security Maintenance**\\\nUnlike standard bug bounty or audit options, [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") or/and Protocol DAO can incentivize whitehats to continuously monitor and maintain the security of your codebase. With their bounty at stake, whitehats have a vested interest in promptly addressing new vulnerabilities and contributing to ongoing security improvements, rather than fixing it once and forgetting about the security of your DAO/dApp/Protocol.\n\n**BETTER TREASURY UTILIZATION**\n\nFor critical bug bounty payments, the project shares the risk with the Hacneproof whitehat community and the undewriter.\n\nThis protects the project treasury from sudden large bug bounty payments.\n\n**BACKED ASSURANCE IN PROOF-OF-SAFETY POOLS**\n\nWhitehats who feel confident about the quality of the code can earn rewards by contributing to the Proof-of-Safety pool,  thereby signaling that the protocol is safe. A second opinion from whitehats, backed by money, is a strong signal of protocol safety.\n\n\\\n**Boost Security Posture: Integrate HackenProof Flash Bounties into the DevSecOps lifecycle**\n\n[HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/ \"hackenproof.com\") Flash Bug Bounties can be integrated into DevSecOps workflows to enable developers to identify vulnerabilities early in development and fix them before software is shipped, improving the overall security posture.\n"

  - header: What's the risk? Could I lose money?
    content: >
      The "Proof-of-Safety pool" will be slashed if:


      * \- Whitehats will find the Bug Bounty's Critical Severity in the desired
      protocol.

      * \- or/and desired protocol is hacked.
